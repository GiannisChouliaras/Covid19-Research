## Research for the course _Data Mining University of Ioannina_

In this research we have tried to find any correlations between the cases and the victims with characteristics of the specific areas. While for the last question we will focus on the United States. We've downloaded the data of the pandemic in 2019 by state as well as the results from the elections, where for each state we have the information whether they elected Democrats or Republicans. We will examine whether there is a statistically interesting difference in the degree of outbreak of the pandemic depending on what the state votes for.
